# Raffle Page
Welcome to the Raffle Page, an interactive platform designed to bring excitement and engagement through raffles. Built with Next.js and MongoDB, this project leverages the powerful features of the Next.js App Router for efficient backend and frontend integration. Whether you are looking to participate in raffles or host your own, this platform provides a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Project Description

The Raffle Page allows users to explore a variety of raffles, purchase tickets, and manage their participation effortlessly. Guest users can easily browse available raffles, buy tickets, and even process refunds, including partial refunds. This ensures that users have flexibility and control over their raffle entries without needing to create an account.

For a more personalized experience, users can register and log in to access additional features. Logged-in users have a dedicated profile page where they can manage their tickets and winnings. The profile page provides a centralized location for users to view their raffle history, claim their winnings, and process refunds efficiently.

Hosting raffles is made simple with the Raffle Page. Registered users can create and manage their own raffles, providing them with tools to set up raffle details, monitor ticket sales, and oversee the drawing process. This feature empowers users to engage their communities or organizations with custom raffles.

The project is built with a focus on performance and scalability. Using Next.js ensures that the platform benefits from server-side rendering, fast load times, and optimized performance. MongoDB is utilized for the database, providing a robust and flexible data storage solution. The platform is hosted on Vercel, taking advantage of its seamless integration with Next.js for easy deployment and scalability.




## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
